<p>Nathaniel Hawthorne was born in Salem, Massachusetts in 1804 (Nathaniel Hawthorne, 2016.)  His early ancestors came to Salem from England around 1630.  Nathaniel’s mother was Elizabeth Clark Hawthorne and his father was a sea captain who dies when Hawthorne was very young.  The death of his father left the Hawthorne family with very little to live off of financially (Nathaniel Hawthorne, 2016.)</p>

<p>At a young age he obtained a leg injury and spent most of his time reading and writing fiction.  In college, the only subject that he was particularly good at was composition.  By the time he'd graduated college, he has an entire novel written, which is known today as “Fanshawe.”  This book did not sell well, but he continued to write. Nathaniel Hawthorne, Bio.com.)  </p>

<p>Soon after college he had written many of his most famous works including “Young Goodman Brown” which is considered to be one of his best compositions.  However, despite the quality of his writings, it took until 1842 for Hawthorne to be able to live off of the income from his books (Nathaniel Hawthorne, Bio.com.)  At this point, Hawthorne and his wife Sophia Peabody moved to Old Manse in Concord, Massachusetts.  His neighbors included other great writers such as Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau (Meyer, Pg. 313.)</p>

<p>Hawthorne found he could not maintain financial security in Concord, so he and his family moved to Salem.  Here he became a surveyor in a Custom House.  However, he was laid off from this job as well.  Having no job gave Hawthorne more time to write, which he used to create his first mass-produced publication, “The Scarlet Letter.”   This is the book that is thought to have made Hawthorne famous (Nathaniel Hawthorne, 2016.)</p>

<p>In the 1852 election, Hawthorne wrote for his friend Franklin Pierce, who was running in the election.  When he won, he gave Hawthorn the American Consul to Britain position and moved Hawthorne’s family to England.  Here, Hawthorne took his family on a trip to Italy (Nathaniel Hawthorne, 2016.)  This trip helped inspire Hawthorne to write The Marble Faun, another famous work that was widely praised in both England and America (Nathaniel Hawthorne, Bio.com.)</p>

<p>Hawthorne began to show signs of age around 1860.  His hair was greying and his mind was regressing.  HIs health began to get worse and he failed to seek out a doctor.  This lead to his death in 1864 (Nathaniel Hawthorne, 2016.) However, despite his death at 59 years old, he is still one of the best known fiction writers of all time.</p>

<p><strong>Foreshadowing</strong> - Foreshadowing is used in “The Birthmark” throughout most of the story.  The death of Georgiana is foreshadowed by all of Aylmer’s failed experiments.  “Looking at him with amazement and fear” (The Birthmark Pg. 338.)  While she is scared, this quote shows that Georgiana trusts and is amazed by the power that Aylmer posses.  This foreshadowing is also so prevalent throughout the story that there is no real twist at the end.</p>

<p><strong>Round Character</strong> - In “Young Goodman Brown” Young Goodman Brown is a round character.  He had all of the qualities of a round character.  These include being complex and the main character of the story.  “He had cast up his eyes in astonishment” (Young Goodman Brown, Pg. 318.)  Brown is also a contradictory character.  This is evident because during the night he is surrounded by those who worship the devil, and during the day he is seen as a normal person.</p>

<p>"On Solidtude" is about Hawthorn and how he feels about being secluded most of his life.  It is written as a letter to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow on June 4, 1837.  Hawthorne begins by telling Wadsworth that he is secluded, but he did not mean to be.  He describes it as, "I have made a captive of myself and put me into a dungeon" (On Solitude, Pg. 344.)  He continues to describe that he does not enjoy living in "the shade."  However, he also explains that he has enjoyed certain parts of living in solitude.  Hawthorne begins to end his letter by stating that he has had a hard time finding things to base his stories on.  Being secluded has dampened his sense of creativity.  One of his final sentences reads, "Whenever I get abroad, I feel just as young as I did, ten years ago" (On Solitude, Pg. 345.)  This statements shows a great deal of information about how long Hawthorne keeps himself secluded from the outside world.</p>

<p><strong>How does Hawthorne regard his solitude?  How does he feel it has affected his life and writing?</strong>
Hawthorne feels his solitude is boring but he is “afraid to come out” (On Solitude, Pg. 344.)  He also states the he “[has] not lived, but only dreamed about living” (On Solitude, Pg. 344.)  These statements show that Hawthorne does not like his solitude but feels that he has to be.  Hawthorne feels that being so secluded has affected his writing in several ways such as not being aware of what the public would think of his writings and not having easy inspiration to base his writings on.</p>

<p>Hawthorne is worth of study because he has written some of the most exceptional writing in history.  The stories he has written such as “The Birthmark” contain many elements such as irony and foreshadowing that are so well written that they can teach the readers about them.  Readers are also able to learn about important teachings such as how you can be inspired by light and learn to be more creative as is stated in “On the Power of the Writer’s Imagination.” This information helped me personally connect with the story “The Black Minister’s Veil.”  During the story, the Minister wears a veil to hide from his shame of having in in God’s eyes.  I too have felt a similar feeling in my life.</p>

<p>I felt that the most engaging character was Aylmer.  Throughout the story “The Birthmark” Aylmer appears to be deranged with his obsession of wanting Georgiana to be perfect.  This obsession eventually leads to the demise of Georgiana.  This was engaging because not only was it an intriguing character, but it also added some unpredictability to the story, as well as the major conflict.  The one thing that I felt challenged my views was in the story “The Birthmark.”  In the story, Aylmer becomes crazed by the fact that Georgiana is not perfect.  Then, he attempts to remove the birthmark but ends up killing her.  This challenged my world views because it opened my eyes to the fact that people with this level of obsession do exist.</p>
